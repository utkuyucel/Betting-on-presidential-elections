# Election Betting Engine

## Overview
This betting engine is a Python simulation that mimics betting on election outcomes. It allows users to place bets, calculates odds dynamically, and determines winnings after the election results.

## Features
- `ElectionOutcome`: Enumerates possible election results.
- `Election`: Tracks total bets for each outcome.
- `Bet`: Represents an individual bet with user, outcome, and amount.
- `BettingSystem`: Manages bets, computes odds, and settles winnings.

## Usage
Run the `main()` function to simulate the betting process, place bets on `TRUMP_WIN` or `BIDEN_WIN`, view the calculated odds, and determine the winnings post-election.

## Installation
Clone the repository and run `python election_betting_engine.py` to start the simulation.
