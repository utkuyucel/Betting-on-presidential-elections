A betting engine for calculating the odds and settling wagers based on the outcomes of a simulated election. This system enables users to place bets on various possible election results, computes the associated odds for each potential outcome using the aggregated bets, and distributes the winnings to the successful bettors proportional to their stakes once the actual result is declared. The software incorporates a class structure to represent elections, bets, and the overarching betting system, making use of enumerations for clear and maintainable outcome definitions.
